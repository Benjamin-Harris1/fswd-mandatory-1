# Movie Tracker Frontend

## A rapid prototype for the mandatory assignment, containing the following features:

### Features

- **Browse Movies & TV Shows**: Grid view with poster displays
- **Search & Filter**: Search, genre filtering and sorting (A-Z, year, rating)
- **Detail Modals**: Click any item to view detailed information
- **Responsive design**: Works for both desktop and mobile view (except for the header, I haven't added the burger menu and made it responsive yet)
- **Tech stack**: React, TypeScript & Tailwindcss

### To run locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Notes**:

- This is a rapid prototype, e.g., I haven't completely decided on what i'll do as my project for the exam - this is something i spun up as a placeholder.
- The search functionality would usually be implemented in the backend, but since this mandatory is frontend only, here you go.
